This test demonstrates what happens when we try to merge the main branch into the current topic branch, when the local
main ref is behind remote. We should prefer merge origin/main, then push that.

First, the setup. We end up with local/topic at commit 1, local/main at commit 1, and remote/main at commit 2.

✓ local/main > echo 'Hello, world!' > foo.txt
✓ local/main > mit commit --all --message 'initial commit'
 
  main is synchronized with origin/main.
   
    │ main → origin/main
    │ 62612b1 initial commit - Bob Ross Jan 1 1970
   
  Run mit undo to undo this change.
 

✓ local/main > mit branch topic
 
  Created topic in /Users/mitchell/projects/mit/.mitscript/local/topic.
 

✓ local/main > echo 'Hey, world!' > foo.txt
✓ local/main > mit commit --all --message 'second commit'
 
  main is synchronized with origin/main.
   
    │ main → origin/main
    │ a89a265 second commit - Bob Ross Jan 1 1970
   
  Run mit undo to undo this change.
 

✓ local/main > git reset --hard HEAD^
HEAD is now at 62612b1 initial commit


Now, the test. We should merge commit 2 into local/topic, even though local/main is at commit 1.

✓ local/topic > mit merge main
 
  main was merged into topic.
   
    │ main → topic
    │ a89a265 second commit - Bob Ross Jan 1 1970
   
  topic is synchronized with origin/topic.
