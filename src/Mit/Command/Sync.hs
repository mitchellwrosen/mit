-- | @mitSyncWith _ maybeUndos@
--
-- Whenever recording what 'mit undo' should do after 'mit sync', if 'maybeUndos' is provided, we use them instead.
-- This is pulled into a function argument to get better undo behavior after committing a merge.
--
-- Consider:
--
-- The user runs 'mit merge foo' (with or without a clean working tree), and gets conflicts. After fixing them, she runs
-- 'mit commit'. This may result in *additional* conflicts due to the just-stashed uncommitted changes.
--
-- But either way, internally, we would like this 'mit commit' to effectively behave as a normal commit, in the sense
-- that we want to immediately push it upstream. That means the code would like to simply call 'mit sync' after
-- 'git commit'!
--
-- However, if this commit could be undone (i.e. we didn't push it), we wouldn't want that 'mit sync' to *locally*
-- compute where to undo, because it would just conclude, "oh, HEAD hasn't moved, and we didn't push, so there's nothing
-- to undo".
--
-- Instead, we want to undo to the point before running the 'mit merge' that caused the conflicts, which were later
-- resolved by 'mit commit'.
