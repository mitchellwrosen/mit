This test demonstrates what happens when we try to merge the main branch into the current topic branch, when the local
main ref is behind remote. We should prefer merge origin/main, then push that.

First, the setup. We end up with local/topic at commit 1, local/main at commit 1, and remote/main at commit 2.

local/main> echo 'Hello, world!' > foo.txt
local/main> mit commit --all --message 'initial commit'
local/main> mit branch topic
local/main> echo 'Hey, world!' > foo.txt
local/main> mit commit --all --message 'second commit'
local/main> git reset --hard HEAD^

Now, the test. We should merge commit 2 into local/topic, even though local/main is at commit 1.

local/topic> mit merge main
