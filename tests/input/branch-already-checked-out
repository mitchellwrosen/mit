`mit branch foo` fails if "foo" is already checked out in a worktree that isn't ../foo, since each branch can only be
checked out in at most one worktree.

local/main> echo 'Hello, world' > hello.txt
local/main> git add --all
local/main> git commit --message 'Initial commit'
local/main> git worktree add -b foo ../bar

local/main> mit branch foo
