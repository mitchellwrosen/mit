This test demonstrates what happens when we try to merge the main branch into the current topic branch, when the local
main ref is behind remote. We should prefer merge origin/main, then push that.

First, the setup. We end up with local/topic at commit 1, local/main at commit 1, and remote/main at commit 2.

local/main> echo 'Hello, world!' > foo.txt # success
local/main> mit commit --all --message 'initial commit' # success
 
  ✓ main ≡ origin/main
   
    │ main → origin/main
    │ cdc6973 initial commit - Bob Ross Jan 1 1970
   
  Run mit undo to undo this change.
 

local/main> mit branch topic # success
 
  Created topic in /home/mitchell/code/projects/mit/.mitscript/local/topic
 

local/main> echo 'Hey, world!' > foo.txt # success
local/main> mit commit --all --message 'second commit' # success
 
  ✓ main ≡ origin/main
   
    │ main → origin/main
    │ b344055 second commit - Bob Ross Jan 1 1970
   
  Run mit undo to undo this change.
 

local/main> git reset --hard HEAD^ # success
HEAD is now at cdc6973 initial commit


Now, the test. We should merge commit 2 into local/topic, even though local/main is at commit 1.

local/topic> mit merge main # success
 
  main was merged into topic.
   
    │ main → topic
    │ b344055 second commit - Bob Ross Jan 1 1970
   
  ✓ topic ≡ origin/topic
